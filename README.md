This repository contains multiple related projects:
- `SharpGrabber` is a *.NET Standard* library for scraping top media providers and grabbing high quality video, audio and information.
- `SharpGrabber.Converter` is a *.NET Standard* library based on `ffmpeg` shared libraries to join audio and video streams. This is particularly useful when grabbing high quality *YouTube* media that might be separated into audio and video files. It is also used for merging HLS stream segments.
- `SharpGrabber.Desktop` A cross-platform desktop application which utilizes both mentioned libraries to expose their functionality to desktop end-users.

## Package Installation
The `SharpGrabber` package defines abstractions only. The actual grabbers have their own packages and should be installed separately.

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber/">SharpGrabber</a> - Core Package
    Install-Package SharpGrabber -Version 2.0.1

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.Converter/">SharpGrabber.Converter</a>
It's an optional package to work with media files. Using this package, you can easily concatenate video segments, or mux audio and video channels.
It uses `ffmpeg` shared libraries underneath.

    Install-Package SharpGrabber.Converter -Version 1.0

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.YouTube/">YouTube</a>
Adds support to download high-quality videos from YouTube, even if they are served as separate video and audio files only.
The high-quality output is possible thanks to the `SharpGrabber.Converter` library.

    Install-Package SharpGrabber.YouTube -Version 1.1

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.Vimeo/">Vimeo</a>
    Install-Package SharpGrabber.Vimeo -Version 1.0

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.Instagram/">Instagram</a>
Warning: This grabber is not guaranteed to work. It works only for clients that Instagram allows anonymous access to public content.

    Install-Package SharpGrabber.Instagram -Version 0.1

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.Hls/">HLS - M3U8 playlists</a>
This package adds the capability to parse M3U8 playlist files - including master playlists - and download video segments.
With the help of the `SharpGrabber.Converter` package, segments may be joined together.
This package also supports `AES-128` decryption.

    Install-Package SharpGrabber.Hls -Version 1.0

### <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGrabber.Adult/">Adult</a> - `PornHub`, `xnxx`, and `xvideos`

    Install-Package SharpGrabber.Adult -Version 1.0.1

## Quick Start
### 1. Start with building a Grabber

    var grabber = GrabberBuilder.New()
        .UseDefaultServices()
        .AddYouTube()
        .AddVimeo()
        .Build();
    
This will result in the creation of a "multi-grabber".

What grabbers you can "add" depends on what packages you've installed. In this example, we have installed YouTube and Vimeo packages.

### 2. Grab from a URI

    var result = await grabber.GrabAsync(new Uri("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTseTg48568"));

No matter what website the URI refers to, the multi-grabber will detect the provider and put the right grabber to use.

### 3. Process the Result

    var info = result.Resource<GrabbedInfo>();
    Console.WriteLine("Time Length: {0}", info.Length);
    var images = result.Resources<GrabbedImage>();
    var videos = result.Resources<GrabbedMedia>();
    
## Upgrade From 1.x to 2.x
ATTENTION! Beware of the breaking changes since v2.0 that requires you to update your code.
The good news is no functionality has been removed, so with a minor refactoring, you should be good to go!
I strongly recommend that you upgrade, v2 has a much cleaner structure and code.
