## Introduction
BlackWidow is a .NET library based on SharpGrabber. Instead of relying on .NET assemblies, it rather executes scripts written specifically for grabbing.
By doing so, the following advantages are gained:

- **Always Up-to-date:** The scripts are always kept up-to-date at runtime; so the functionality of the host application won't break - at least not for long!
- **Easy Maintenance:** *JavaScript* is darn easy to write and understand! This helps contributors to quickly write new grabbers or fix existing ones.
- **Secure**: The scripts are executed in a sandbox environment, and they only have access to what BlackWidow API exposes to them.

## How does it work?
*WIP*
